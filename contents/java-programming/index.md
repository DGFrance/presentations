# Part 1 Overview

- Characteristics
- Platform
- Java code structure

---

## Characteristics

- Simple, Object Oriented, and Familiar
- Robust and Secure
- Architecture Neutral and Portable
- High Performance
- Interpreted, Threaded, and Dynamic

<br>
![alt text](images/java-build.png "Java Compiler")

Note:

Simple doesn't mean easy to create program, programming is always hard.
- Automatic memory management (GC)
- Simplifies pointer handling
- Simple Network Library (Socket/DBMS)
- Designed to be object oriented from the ground up
- C++ syntax streamlined
- C# similarity
- Has a rich set of standard libraries: networking, thread, persistence, data structure, web service
- Restrictions on permissible operations can be enforced: memory manipulation, applet by default has no permission to read/write file and execute local program
- Extensive compile-time checking, and run-time checking for security
- JVM optimization
- Static compile time, Dynamic run-time

---

## Platform

A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs.

- Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
- Java Application Programming Interface (API)

![alt text](images/getStarted-jvm.gif "Java Platform")

<small>The Java platform can be a bit slower than native code due to its platform-independent environment. However Java provides just in time (JIT) compilation and optimization which bring performance close to native code.</small>

## "Hello World!"

- Code <!-- .element: class="fa-code" -->

```java
package com.mitrais.app;

/**
 * The HelloWorldApp class implements an application that
 * simply prints "Hello World!" to standard output.
 */
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!"); // Display the string.
    }
}
```

- Compile and Run <!-- .element: class="fa-code" -->

```bash
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
Hello World!
```

Note:
Discuss about comments syntax, class definition, main method, usage of core library System.out

---

## Java Byte Code

```bash
javap -c  HelloWorld

public class HelloWorld {
  public HelloWorld();
    Code:
       0: aload_0
       1: invokespecial #1      // Method java/lang/Object."<init>":()V
       4: return

  public static void main(java.lang.String[]);
    Code:
       0: getstatic     #2      // Field java/lang/System.out:Ljava/io/PrintStream;
       3: ldc           #3      // String Hello, World!
       5: invokevirtual #4      // Method java/io/PrintStream.println:(Ljava/lang/String;)V
       8: return
}
```

## Summary

- Java is a general purpose language: desktop, web, mobile, more
- Java has a number of good features, but not better in every way than all other languages
- What makes Java better is not the language itself but also the JVM
- Reasons for using Java
  - Features, widespread use, tools, and libraries, platform
  - Java is not the only hammer you have

# Part 2 Tools Setup

- Maven
- Git
- Unit Test

---

## Maven

- Is a Java build tool (project, dependency management)
- Used for Java projects
- Adopt convention over configuration
- Under Apache Software Foundation (mostly supported by SonaType)

![alt text](images/maven-process.png "Maven Process")

---

## Java builds

Build Tools Advantages

- Portability
- Automation
- Repeatability

![alt text](../gradle/images/java-build.svg "Typical Java build process")

---

## Mindset

- All build systems are essentially the same:
  - Compile Source code
  - Copy Resource
  - Compile and Run Tests
  - Package Project
  - Deploy Project
  - Cleanup
- Describe the project and configure the build
  - You donâ€™t script a build
  - Maven has no concept of a condition
  - Plugins are configured

---

## How does it works?

- Build configured using pom.xml file
- POM = Project Object Model
- Uses standard build order, project layout
- Identifies dependencies in the pom.xml file
- POM can call child POM's

---

## Structure

![alt text](images/maven-project-layout.png "Maven Structure") <!-- .element: height="500px" -->

---

## Setup & Install

- Download [https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
- Extract to local directory e.g. `C:\maven` or `/opt/maven`
- Create or modify `PATH` environment variable to include maven executable e.g. `c:\maven\bin`
- Test maven with command `mvn -v`

```
Apache Maven 3.2.5 (12a6b3acb947671f09b81f49094c53f426d8cea1; 2014-12-15T00:29:23+07:00)

## POM Structure

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
         xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0

```

## GroupId
- A group ID is a universally unique identifier for a project. While this is often just the project name (eg. commons-collections), it is helpful to use a fully-qualified package name to distinguish it from other projects with a similar name (eg. org.apache.maven).
- groupId will identify your project uniquely across all projects, so we need to enforce a naming schema. It has to follow the package name rules, what means that has to be at least as a domain name you control, and you can create as many subgroups as you want.

---

## ArtifactId
- An artifact is something that is either produced or used by a project. Examples of artifacts produced by Maven for a project include: JARs, source and binary distributions, WARs. Each artifact is uniquely identified by a group id and an artifact ID which is unique within a group
- artifactId is the name of the jar without version. If you created it then you can choose whatever name you want with lowercase letters and no strange symbols. If it's a third party jar you have to take the name of the jar as it's distributed. eg. maven, commons-math

---

## Packaging
- Packaging in maven defines the artifact that will be produced by maven and the "maven package" goal is the one that will compile the code, gather the resources, run the unit tests and build a deployable artefact (JAR, WAR, EAR, etc.)
- The products of Maven are always written to the "target" directory.

---

## Dependencies
- Most every project depends upon others to build and run correctly
- Maven lists all the dependencies of every project and its transitive dependencies, allowing your list to focus solely on the dependencies your project requires.

---

## Dependency Scope
- This element refers to the classpath of the task at hand (compiling and runtime, testing, etc.) as well as how to limit the transitivity of a dependency. There are five scopes available:
    - compile
    - provided
    - runtime
    - test
    - system

---

## Archetype
- Maven project templating toolkit
- syntax "mvn archetype:generate"
- Maven Quickstart archetype
    - mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeGroupId=org.apache.maven.archetypes -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DarchetypeVersion=5-SNAPSHOT

---

## Maven Phase
- General build tasks
    - mvn clean
    - mvn validate
    - mvn compile
    - mvn test
    - mvn package
    - mvn verify
    - mvn install
    - mvn deploy
- Optionally, specify multiple build tasks
    - mvn clean install
