## Topics

-  Lambda building blocks in java.util.function
  - Simply-typed versions
    -  *Blah*UnaryOperator, *Blah*BinaryOperator, *Blah*Predicate, *Blah*Consumer
  - Generically-typed versions
    -  Predicate
    -  Function
    -  BinaryOperator
    -  Consumer
    -  Supplier

---

## Lambda Building Blocks

- java.util.function: many reusable interfaces
  - Although they are technically interfaces with ordinary methods, they are treated as
though they were functions
- Simply typed interfaces
  - IntPredicate, LongUnaryOperator, DoubleBinaryOperator, etc.
- Generically typed interfaces
  - ```Predicate<T>``` — T in, boolean out
  - ```Function<T,R>``` — T in, R out
  - ```Consumer<T>``` — T in, nothing (void) out
  - ```Supplier<T>``` — Nothing in, T out
  - ```BinaryOperator<T>``` — Two T’s in, T out

---

## Simply Typed Building Block

- Interfaces like Integrable widely used
  - So, Java 8 should build in many common cases
- Can be used in wide variety of contexts
  - So need more general name than “Integrable”
- java.util.function defines many simple functional (SAM) interfaces
  - Named according to arguments and return values
    - E.g., replace my Integrable with builtin DoubleUnaryOperator
  - You need to look in API for the method names
    - Although the lambdas themselves don’t refer to method names,
    your code that uses the lambdas will need to call the methods explicitly

---

## Simply-Typed and Generic Interfaces

- Types given
  - Samples (many others!)
    - IntPredicate (int in, boolean out)
    - LongUnaryOperator (long in, long out)
    - DoubleBinaryOperator(two doubles in, double out)
  - Example

```
    DoubleBinaryOperator f = (d1, d2) -> Math.cos(d1 + d2);
```

- Genericized
  - There are also generic interfaces (`Function<T,R>`, `Predicate<T>`, etc.) with widespread applicability
    - And concrete methods like “compose” and “negate”

---

## Interface from Previous Part

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Integrable {
    double eval(double x);
}
```

## Numerical Integration Method

```java
public static double integrate(Integrable function,
                               double x1, double x2,
                               int numSlices){
    if (numSlices < 1) {
        numSlices = 1;
    }
    double delta = (x2 - x1)/numSlices;
    double start = x1 + delta/2;
    double sum = 0;
    for(int i=0; i<numSlices; i++) {
        sum += delta * function.eval(start + delta * i);
    }
    return(sum);
}
```

---

## Method for Testing

```java
public static void integrationTest(Integrable function,
                                   double x1, double x2) {
    for(int i=1; i<7; i++) {
        int numSlices = (int)Math.pow(10, i);
        double result = MathUtilities.integrate(function, x1, x2, numSlices);
        System.out.printf(" For numSlices =%,10d result = %,.8f%n",
                          numSlices, result);
    }
}
```

## Using Numerical Integration

```java
MathUtilities.integrationTest(x -> x*x, 10, 100);
MathUtilities.integrationTest(x -> Math.pow(x,3), 50, 500);
MathUtilities.integrationTest(Math::sin, 0, Math.PI);
MathUtilities.integrationTest(Math::exp, 2, 20);
```

---

## Using Builtin Building Blocks

- In integration example, replace this

```java
public static double integrate(Integrable function, …) {
    ... function.eval(...); ...
}
```

- With this

```java
public static double integrate(DoubleUnaryOperator function, …) {
... function.applyAsDouble(...); ...
}
```

- Then, omit definition of Integrable entirely
  - Because DoubleUnaryOperator is a functional (SAM) interface containing a method
    <br>with the same signature as the method of the Integrable interface

---

## General Case

- If you are tempted to create an interface purely to be used as a
target for a lambda
  - Look through `java.util.function` and see if one of the functional (SAM) interfaces
there can be used instead

---

## General Case

- DoubleUnaryOperator, IntUnaryOperator, LongUnaryOperator
  - double/int/long in, same type out
- DoubleBinaryOperator, IntBinaryOperator, LongBinaryOperator
  - Two doubles/ints/longs in, same type out
- DoublePredicate, IntPredicate, LongPredicate
  - double/int/long in, boolean out
- DoubleConsumer, IntConsumer, LongConsumer
  - double/int/long in, void return type
- Genericized interfaces: Function, Predicate, Consumer, etc.
  - Covered in next section

---

## Generic Building Blocks: Predicate
- Simplified definition

```java
public interface Predicate<T> {//Simplified because Predicate has some
    boolean test(T t);         //non-abstract methods (covered later), and
}                              //it uses the @FunctionalInterface annotation.
```

- Idea: Lets you make a “function” to test a condition
- Benefit: Lets you search collections for entry or entries that match a condition, with much
less repeated code than without lambdas
- Syntax example

```java
Predicate<Employee> matcher = e -> e.getSalary() > 50_000;
	if(matcher.test(someEmployee)) {
		doSomethingWith(someEmployee);
}
```

---

## Predicate Example: Finding Entries in List that Match Some Test

- Idea: Take a subset of the list by throwing away entries that fail a test
- Java 7
  - You tended to repeat the code for different types of tests
- Java 8 first cut
  - Use `Predicate<TypeInOurList>` to generalize the test
- Java 8 second cut
  - Use `Predicate<T>` to generalize to different types of lists
- Java 8 third cut (later training material)
  - Use the built-in filter method of Stream to get the benefits of chaining, lazy evaluation, and parallelization

---

## Without Predicate

Finding Employee by First Name

```java
public static Employee findEmployeeByFirstName(List<Employee> employees, String firstName) {
    for(Employee e: employees) {
        if(e.getFirstName().equals(firstName)) {
            return(e);
        }
    }
    return(null);
}
```

Finding Employee by Salary

```java
public static Employee findEmployeeBySalary(List<Employee> employees, double salaryCutoff) {
    for(Employee e: employees) {
        if(e.getSalary() >= salaryCutoff) {
            return(e);
        }
    }                   //Most of the code is repeated.
    return(null);       //If we searched by last name or employee ID,
}                       //we would yet again repeat most of the code.
```

---

## Refactor #1: Finding First Employee that Passes

```java
public static Employee firstMatchingEmployee(List<Employee> candidates,
                                             Predicate<Employee> matchFunction) {
    for(Employee possibleMatch: candidates) {
        if(matchFunction.test(possibleMatch)) {
            return(possibleMatch);
        }
    }
    return(null);                   //Notice the second parameter
}                                   //and IF condition
```

## Calling methods

```java
firstMatchingEmployee(employees, e -> e.getSalary() > 500_000);
firstMatchingEmployee(employees, e -> e.getLastName().equals("…"));
firstMatchingEmployee(employees, e -> e.getId() < 10);
```

---

## Refactor 1 - Benefits

- Now
  - We can now pass in different match functions to search on different criteria. Succinct and readable.

```java
firstMatchingEmployee(employees, e -> e.getSalary() > 500_000);
```

```java
firstMatchingEmployee(employees, e -> e.getLastName().equals("…"));
```

```java
firstMatchingEmployee(employees, e -> e.getId() < 10);
```

---

## Refactor 1 - Benefits

- Before
  - Cumbersome interface.
<br>Without lambdas, we could have defined an interface with a “test” method, then
instantiated the interface and passed it in, to avoid some of the previously repeated
code. But, this approach would be so verbose that it wouldn’t seem worth it in most
cases.
- The code is still tied to the Employee class, so we can do even better (next slide).

---

## Refactor #2: Finding First Entry that Passes Test

```java
public static <T> T firstMatch(List<T> candidates, Predicate<T> matchFunction) {
    for(T possibleMatch: candidates) {//Notice the generic classes (<T>)
        if(matchFunction.test(possibleMatch)) {
            return(possibleMatch);
        }
    }
    return(null);
}
```

<br>
We can now pass in different match functions to search on different criteria as before,
but can do so for any type, not just for Employees. <!-- .element: style="text-align: left;" -->

---

## Refactor #2: Usage

- firstMatchingEmployee examples still work

```java
firstMatch(employees, e -> e.getSalary() > 500_000);
```

```java
firstMatch(employees, e -> e.getLastName().equals("…"));
```

```java
firstMatch(employees, e -> e.getId() < 10);
```

- But more general code now also works

```java
Country firstBigCountry = firstMatch(countries, c -> c.getPopulation() > 10_000_000);
```

```java
Car firstCheapCar = firstMatch(cars, c -> c.getPrice() < 15_000);
```

```java
Company firstSmallCompany = firstMatch(companies, c -> c.numEmployees() <= 50);
```

```java
String firstShortString = firstMatch(strings, s -> s.length() < 4);
```

---

## Testing Lookup by First Name

```java
private static final List<Employee> EMPLOYEES = EmployeeSamples.getSampleEmployees();
private static final String[] FIRST_NAMES = { "Archie", "Amy", "Andy" };

@Test
public void testNames() {
    assertThat(findEmployeeByFirstName(EMPLOYEES, FIRST_NAMES[0]), is(notNullValue()));
    for(String firstName: FIRST_NAMES) {
        Employee match1 = findEmployeeByFirstName(EMPLOYEES, firstName);
        Employee match2 = firstMatchingEmployee(EMPLOYEES, e -> e.getFirstName().equals(firstName));
        Employee match3 = firstMatch(EMPLOYEES, e -> e.getFirstName().equals(firstName));
        assertThat(match1, allOf(equalTo(match2), equalTo(match3)));
    }
}
```

---

## Testing Lookup by First Name

Testing goals:<!-- .element: style="text-align: left;" -->
- The hardcoded version gives same answer as the version with the Predicate<Employee>, but not merely by both always returning null.
- The version with generic types gives same answer and has identical syntax (except for method name) as the version with Predicate<Employee>.
Reminder: JUnit covered in earlier section

---

## Testing Lookup by Salary

```java
private static final List<Employee> EMPLOYEES = EmployeeSamples.getSampleEmployees();
private static final int[] SALARY_CUTOFFS = { 200_000, 300_000, 400_000 };

@Test
public void testSalaries() {
    assertThat(findEmployeeBySalary(EMPLOYEES, SALARY_CUTOFFS[0]), is(notNullValue()));
    for(int cutoff: SALARY_CUTOFFS) {
        Employee match1 = findEmployeeBySalary(EMPLOYEES, cutoff);
        Employee match2 = firstMatchingEmployee(EMPLOYEES, e -> e.getSalary() >= cutoff);
        Employee match3 = firstMatch(EMPLOYEES, e -> e.getSalary() >= cutoff);
        assertThat(match1, allOf(equalTo(match2), equalTo(match3)));
    }
}
```

---

## General Lambda Principles (Revisited)

- Interfaces in Java 8 are same as in Java 7
  - Predicate is same in Java 8 as it would have been in Java 7, except you can (and should!) optionally use `@FunctionalInterface`
    - To catch errors (multiple methods) at compile time
    - To express design intent (developers should use lambdas)

---

## General Lambda Principles (Revisited)

- Code that uses interfaces is the same in Java 8 as in Java 7
  - I.e., the definition of firstMatch is exactly the same as you would have written it in
  Java 7. The author of `firstMatch` must know that the real method name is test.
- Code that calls methods that expect 1-method interfaces can now use lambdas

```java
firstMatch(employees, e -> e.getSalary() > 500_000);
```

---

## Generic Building Blocks: Function

- Simplified definition

```java
public interface Function<T,R> {
    R apply(T t);
}
```

- Idea: Lets you make a “function” that takes in a T and returns an R
- BiFunction is similar, but “apply” takes two arguments
- Benefit: Lets you transform a value or collection of values, with much less repeated code than without lambdas

```java
Function<Employee, Double> raise = e -> e.getSalary() * 1.1;
for(Employee employee: employees) {
    employee.setSalary(raise.apply(employee));
}
```

---

## Example 1: Refactoring our String-Transformation Code

- Previously we made `StringFunction` interface and transform method to demonstrate different types of method references.
- Refactor 1
  - Replace `StringFunction` with `Function<String, String>`
  - But we also have to change the transform method. General lambda principle:
  code that uses the interfaces is the same as in Java 7, and must know the real method name.

---

## Example 1: Refactoring our String-Transformation Code

- Refactor 2
  - Use `Function<T,R>` instead of `Function<String,String>`
  - Generalize transform to take in a T and return an R

---

## Previous Section: Transforming with StringFunction

- Our interface

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface StringFunction {
    String applyFunction(String s);
}
```

- Our method

```java
public static String transform(String s, StringFunction f) {
    return(f.applyFunction(s));
}
```

- Sample usage

```java
String result = Utils.transform(someString, String::toUpperCase);
```

---

## Refactor 1: Use Function

- Our interface
  - None!
- Our method

```java
public static String transform(String s, Function<String, String> f) { //StringFunction to Function<String, String>
    return(f.apply(s)); //applyFunction to apply
}
```

- Sample use (unchanged)

```java
String result = Utils.transform(someString, String::toUpperCase);
```

---

## Refactor 2: Generalize the Types

- Our interface
  - None
- Our method

```java
public static <T,R> R transform(T value, Function<T,R> f) { //Notice the type generalization from String to T or R
    return(f.apply(value));
}
```

- Sample usage (more general)

```java
String result = Utils.transform(someString, String::toUpperCase);
List<String> words = Arrays.asList("hi", "bye");
int size = Utils.transform(words, List::size);
```

---

## Example 2: Finding Sum of Arbitrary Property

- Idea
  - Very common to take a list of employees and add up their salaries
  - Also common to take a list of countries and add up their populations
  - Also common to take a list of cars and add up their prices
- Java 7
  - You tended to repeat the code for each of those cases
- Java 8
  - Use Function to generalize the transformation operation (salary, population, price)

---

## Without Function

Finding Sum of Employee Salaries

```java
public static int salarySum(List<Employee> employees) {
    int sum = 0;
    for(Employee employee: employees) {
        sum += employee.getSalary();
    }
    return(sum);
}
```

<br>
Finding Sum of Country Populations

```java
public static int populationSum(List<Country> countries) {
    int sum = 0;
    for(Country country: countries) {
        sum += country.getPopulation(); //notice the difference is only on this line
    }
    return(sum);
}
```

---

## With Function

Finding Sum of Arbitrary Property

```java
public static <T> int mapSum(List<T> entries, Function<T, Integer> mapper) { //using Function
    int sum = 0;
    for(T entry: entries) {
        sum += mapper.apply(entry); //using Function
    }
    return(sum);
}
```

<br>
You can reproduce the results of salarySum and populationSum by using the same method

```java
int salarySum = mapSum(employees, Employee::getSalary);
```

```java
int populationSum = mapSum(countries, Country::getPopulation);
```

---

## Results

- You can also do many other types of sums:

```java
int totalWeight = mapSum(packages, Package::getWeight);
```

```java
int totalFleetPrice = mapSum(cars, Car::getStickerPrice);
```

```java
int regionPopulation = mapSum(countries, Country::getPopulation);
```

```java
int regionElderlyPopulation = mapSum(listOfCountries, c -> c.getPopulation() – c.getPopulationUnderSixty());
```

```java
int sumOfNumbers = mapSum(listOfIntegers, Function.identity());
```

---

## Generic Building Blocks: BinaryOperator

- Simplified definition

```java
public interface BinaryOperator<T> {
    T apply(T t1, T t2);
}
```

- Idea: Lets you make a “function” that takes in two T’s and returns a T
    - This is a specialization of BiFunction<T,U,R> where T, U, and R are all the same type.

---

## Generic Building Blocks: BinaryOperator

- Benefit
  - See `Function`. Having all the values be same type makes it particularly useful for
  “reduce” operations that combine values from a collection.
- Syntax example

```java
BinaryOperator<Integer> adder = (n1, n2) -> n1 + n2;
// The lambda above could be replaced by Integer::sum
int sum = adder.apply(num1, num2);
```

---

## BinaryOperator: Applications

- Make mapSum more flexible, instead of

```java
mapSum(List<T> entries, Function<T, Integer> mapper)
```

you could generalize further and pass in combining operator (which was hardcoded to “+” in mapSum)

```java
mapReduce(List<T> entries, Function<T, R> mapper, BinaryOperator<R> combiner)
```

- Hypothetical examples

```java
int payroll = mapReduce(employees, Employee::getSalary, Integer::sum);
```

```java
double lowestPrice = mapReduce(cars, Car::getPrice, Math::min);
```

---

## BinaryOperator: Applications

- Problem:
What do you do if there are no entries? mapSum would return 0, but what would
`mapReduce` return? We will deal with this exact issue when we cover the reduce method of
Stream, which uses `BinaryOperator` in just this manner.

---

## Generic Building Blocks: Consumer

- Simplified definition

```java
public interface Consumer<T> {
    void accept(T t);
}
```

- Idea: Lets you make a “function” that takes in a T and does some side effect to it (with no
return value)
- Benefit: Lets you do an operation (print each value, set a raise, etc.) on a collection of values,
with much less repeated code than without lambdas

```java
Consumer<Employee> raise = e -> e.setSalary(e.getSalary() * 1.1);
for(Employee employee: employees) {
    raise.accept(employee);
}
```

---

## Consumer: Application

- The builtin `forEach` method of `Stream` uses `Consumer`

```java
employees.forEach(e -> e.setSalary(e.getSalary()*1.1));
```

```java
values.forEach(System.out::println);
```

```java
textFields.forEach(field -> field.setText(""));
```

<br>
- See later training about `Stream` for more detail

---

## Generic Building Blocks: Supplier

- Simplified definition

```java
public interface Supplier<T> {
    T get();
}
```

- Idea: Lets you make a no-arg “function” that returns a T. It can do so by calling “new”,
using an existing object, or anything else it wants.
- Benefit: Lets you swap object-creation functions in and out. Especially useful for switching
among testing, production, etc.

```java
Supplier<Employee> maker1 = Employee::new;
Supplier<Employee> maker2 = () -> randomEmployee();
Employee e1 = maker1.get();
Employee e2 = maker2.get();
```

---

## Using Supplier to Randomly Make Different Types of Person

```java
private final static Supplier[] peopleGenerators =
    { Person::new, Writer::new, Artist::new, Consultant::new,
      EmployeeSamples::randomEmployee,
      () -> { Writer w = new Writer();
              w.setFirstName("Ernest");
              w.setLastName("Hemingway");
              w.setBookType(Writer.BookType.FICTION);
              return(w); }
    };

public static Person randomPerson() {
    Supplier<Person> generator = RandomUtils.randomElement(peopleGenerators);
    return(generator.get());
}
```

When `randomPerson` is called, it first randomly chooses one of the people generators, then
uses that `Supplier` to build an instance of a `Person` or subclass of `Person`.

---

## Helper Method: randomElement

```java
public class RandomUtils {
    private static Random r = new Random();

    public static int randomInt(int range) {
        return(r.nextInt(range));
    }

    public static int randomIndex(Object[] array) {
        return(randomInt(array.length));
    }

    public static <T> T randomElement(T[] array) { //helper method
        return(array[randomIndex(array)]);
    }
}
```

---

## Using randomPerson

- Test code

```java
System.out.printf("%nSupplier Examples%n");
    for(int i=0; i<10; i++) {
        System.out.printf("Random person: %s.%n",
                          EmployeeUtils.randomPerson());
}
```

- Results (one of many possible outcomes)

```text
Supplier Examples
Random person: Andrea Carson (Consultant).
Random person: Desiree Designer [Employee#14 $212,000].
Random person: Andrea Evans (Artist).
Random person: Devon Developer [Employee#11 $175,000].

```
