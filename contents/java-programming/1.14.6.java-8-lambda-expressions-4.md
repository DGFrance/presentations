# Part 14.6 Lambda Expression Part 4

Higher Order Function

---

## Topics

- Big idea: methods that return lambdas
- From Predicate: and, or, negate, isEqual
- From Function: andThen, compose, identity
- From Consumer: andThen
- Custom methods

---

## Methods that Return Functions

- Methods can return “functions”
  - Really objects that implement functional interfaces
  - You can also have a lambda that returns another lambda
- Predicate, Function, and Consumer have builtin methods that return lambdas
- Benefit
  - By thinking of these return values as functions, you can have methods
  that compose functions, negate functions, chain functions, and so forth.

```java
Predicate<Employee> isRich = e -> e.getSalary() > 200000;
Predicate<Employee> isEarly = e -> e.getEmployeeId() <= 10;
empList = allMatches(employees, isRich.and(isEarly));
```

---

## Example: combinedOp

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Op {
    void runOp();

    static void timeOp(Op operation) {
        // Unchanged from last example
    }

    default Op combinedOp(Op secondOp) {
        return(() -> { runOp(); secondOp.runOp(); });
    }
}
```

## Higher Order Functions in Predicate

- and
  - Given a Predicate as an argument, produces a new Predicate whose test method is true if
  both the original Predicate and the argument Predicate return true for the given argument.
  Default method.
- or
  - Given a Predicate as an argument, produces a new Predicate whose test method is true if
  either the original Predicate or the argument Predicate return true for the given argument.
  Default method.

---

## Higher Order Functions in Predicate

- negate
  - Takes no arguments: returns a Predicate whose test method returns the opposite of
  whatever the original Predicate returned. Default method.
- isEqual
  - Given an Object as an argument, produces a Predicate whose test method returns true if the
  Predicate argument is equals to the Object. Static method.

---

## Test Code: allMatches

- Idea
  - Given a list and a predicate, returns new list of all the entries in the old list that passed the test.
  Very similar to filter method of Stream, which we will cover later
- Code

```java
public static <T> List<T> allMatches(List<T> candidates,
                                     Predicate<T> matchFunction) {
    List<T> matches = new ArrayList<>();
    for(T possibleMatch: candidates) {
        if(matchFunction.test(possibleMatch)) {
            matches.add(possibleMatch);
        }
    }
    return(matches);
}
```

---

## Examples of and, or, negate, isEqual

```java
private static final List<Employee> employees = EmployeeSamples.getSampleEmployees();
public static void predicateExamples() {
    Predicate<Employee> isRich = e -> e.getSalary() > 200000;
    Predicate<Employee> isEarly = e -> e.getEmployeeId() <= 10;
    System.out.printf("Rich employees: %s.%n",
                      allMatches(employees, isRich));
    System.out.printf("Employees hired early: %s.%n",
                      allMatches(employees, isEarly));
    System.out.printf("Employees that are rich AND hired early: %s.%n",
                      allMatches(employees, isRich.and(isEarly)));
    System.out.printf("Employees that are rich OR hired early: %s.%n",
                      allMatches(employees, isRich.or(isEarly)));
    System.out.printf("Employees that are NOT rich: %s.%n",
                      allMatches(employees, isRich.negate()));
    Employee polly = employees.get(1);
    Predicate<Employee> isPolly = Predicate.isEqual(polly);
    System.out.printf("Employees in list that are 'equals' to Polly Programmer: %s.%n",
                      allMatches(employees, isPolly));
}
```

---

## Result

```dos
Rich employees:
    [Harry Hacker [Employee#1 $234,567], Polly Programmer [Employee#2 $333,333],
     Desiree Designer [Employee#14 $212,000]].
Employees hired early:
    [Harry Hacker [Employee#1 $234,567], Polly Programmer [Employee#2 $333,333],
     Cody Coder [Employee#8 $199,999]].
Employees that are rich AND hired early:
    [Harry Hacker [Employee#1 $234,567], Polly Programmer [Employee#2 $333,333]].
Employees that are rich OR hired early:
    [Harry Hacker [Employee#1 $234,567], Polly Programmer [Employee#2 $333,333],
     Cody Coder [Employee#8 $199,999], Desiree Designer [Employee#14 $212,000]].
Employees that are NOT rich:
    [Cody Coder [Employee#8 $199,999], Devon Developer [Employee#11 $175,000],
     Archie Architect [Employee#16 $144,444], Tammy Tester [Employee#19 $166,777],
     Sammy Sales [Employee#21 $45,000], Larry Lawyer [Employee#22 $33,000],
     Amy Accountant [Employee#25 $85,000]].
Employees in list that are 'equals' to Polly Programmer:
    [Polly Programmer [Employee#2 $333,333]].
```

---

## Extending allMatches

```java
public static <T> Predicate<T> combinedPredicate(Predicate<T>... tests) {
    Predicate<T> result = e -> true;
    for(Predicate<T> test: tests) {
        result = result.and(test);
    }
    return(result);
}

public static <T> List<T> allMatches2(List<T> candidates,
                                      Predicate<T>... matchFunctions) {
    Predicate<T> combinedTest = combinedPredicate(matchFunctions);
    return(allMatches(candidates, combinedTest));
}
```

---

## Using allMatches2

```java
private static List<String> words =
    Arrays.asList("hi", "hello", "hola", "bye", "goodbye", "adios");

public static void allMatch2Examples() {
    List<String> hWords = allMatches2(words, word -> word.contains("h"));
    System.out.printf("Words with h: %s.%n", hWords);
    List<String> hlWords = allMatches2(words, word -> word.contains("h"),
                                       word -> word.contains("l"));
    System.out.printf("Words with h and l: %s.%n", hlWords);
    List<String> hlShortWords = allMatches2(words, word -> word.contains("h"),
                                            word -> word.contains("l"),
                                            word -> word.length() <= 4);
    System.out.printf("Words with h and l and length <= 4: %s.%n",
                      hlShortWords);
}
```

```dos
Words with h: [hi, hello, hola].
Words with h and l: [hello, hola].
Words with h and l and length <= 4: [hola].
```

## Higher Order Functions in Function

- compose
  - f1.compose(f2) means to first run f2, then pass the result to f1. Default method.
    - Of course, you cannot really “call” lambdas. So, strictly speaking, f1.compose(f2)
    means to produce a Function whose apply method, when called, first passes the
    argument to the apply method of f2, then passes the result to the apply method of f1.
- andThen
  - f1.andThen(f2) means to first run f1, then pass the result to f2. So, f2.andThen(f1) is
  the same as f1.compose(f2). Math people usually think of “compose” instead of
  “andThen”.

---

## Higher Order Functions in Function

- identity
  - Function.identity() creates a function whose apply method just returns the argument
  unchanged. Static method.

---

## Test Code: transform

- Idea: Given a list and a function, returns new list by passing all the entries in the old list
through the function
- Very similar to map method of `Stream`, which we will cover later
- Code

```java
public static <T,R> List<R> transform(List<T> origValues,
Function<T,R> transformer) {
    List<R> transformedValues = new ArrayList<>();
    for(T value: origValues) {
        transformedValues.add(transformer.apply(value));
    }
    return(transformedValues);
}
```

---

## Using transform

```java
public static void transformExamples() {
    System.out.printf("Original words: %s.%n", words);
    Function<String,String> makeUpperCase = String::toUpperCase;
    List<String> upperCaseWords = transform(words, makeUpperCase);
    System.out.printf("Uppercase: %s.%n", upperCaseWords);
    Function<String,String> makeExciting = word -> word + ": Wow!";
    List<String> excitingWords = transform(words, makeExciting);
    System.out.printf("Exciting: %s.%n", excitingWords);
    Function<String,String> makeBoth1 = makeExciting.compose(makeUpperCase);
    List<String> excitingUpperCaseWords1 = transform(words, makeBoth1);
    System.out.printf("Exciting uppercase[1]: %s.%n", excitingUpperCaseWords1);
    Function<String,String> makeBoth2 = makeUpperCase.andThen(makeExciting);
    List<String> excitingUpperCaseWords2 = transform(words, makeBoth2);
    System.out.printf("Exciting uppercase[2]: %s.%n", excitingUpperCaseWords2);
}
```

---

## Results

```text
Original words: [hi, hello, hola, bye, goodbye, adios].
Uppercase: [HI, HELLO, HOLA, BYE, GOODBYE, ADIOS].
Exciting:
[hi: Wow!, hello: Wow!, hola: Wow!, bye: Wow!, goodbye: Wow!, adios: Wow!].
Exciting uppercase[1]:
[HI: Wow!, HELLO: Wow!, HOLA: Wow!, BYE: Wow!, GOODBYE: Wow!, ADIOS: Wow!].
Exciting uppercase[2]:
[HI: Wow!, HELLO: Wow!, HOLA: Wow!, BYE: Wow!, GOODBYE: Wow!, ADIOS: Wow!].
```

---

## Goal: Chained Function Composition

- Idea
  - Modify the transform method so that it takes any number of Functions, instead of
just one. It will compose all the functions, then use the result to transform entries.
- Example usage

```java
List<String> words = ...;
Function<String,String> makeUpperCase = String::toUpperCase;
Function<String,String> makeExciting = word -> word + ": Wow!";
List<String> excitingUpperCaseWords =
    transform2(words, makeExciting, makeUpperCase);
```

---

## Extending transform: composeAll

```java
public static <T> Function<T,T> composeAll (Function<T,T>... functions) {
    Function<T,T> result = Function.identity();
    for(Function<T,T> f: functions) {
        result = result.compose(f);
    }
    return(result);
}
```

## Extending transform: transform2

```java
public static <T> List<T> transform2 (List<T> origValues,
                                      Function<T,T>... transformers) {
    Function<T,T> composedFunction = composeAll(transformers);
    return(transform(origValues, composedFunction));
}
```

---

## Using transform2

```java
public static void transform2Examples() {
    System.out.printf("Original words: %s.%n", words);
    Function<String,String> makeUpperCase = String::toUpperCase;
    List<String> upperCaseWords = transform2(words, makeUpperCase);
    System.out.printf("Uppercase: %s.%n", upperCaseWords);
    Function<String,String> makeExciting = word -> word + ": Wow!";
    List<String> excitingWords = transform2(words, makeExciting);
    System.out.printf("Exciting: %s.%n", excitingWords);
    List<String> excitingUpperCaseWords =
        transform2(words, makeExciting, makeUpperCase);
    System.out.printf("Exciting uppercase: %s.%n", excitingUpperCaseWords);
}
```

```text
Original words: [hi, hello, hola, bye, goodbye, adios].
Uppercase: [HI, HELLO, HOLA, BYE, GOODBYE, ADIOS].
Exciting: [hi: Wow!, hello: Wow!, hola: Wow!, bye: Wow!, goodbye: Wow!, adios: Wow!].
Exciting uppercase: [HI: Wow!, HELLO: Wow!, HOLA: Wow!, BYE: Wow!, GOODBYE: Wow!, ADIOS: Wow!].
```

## Typing Issues with compose and Method References

- Legal: two steps

```java
Function<Double,Double> round = Math::rint;
transform(nums, round.compose(Math::sqrt));
```

- Illegal: one step

```java
transform(nums, Math::rint.compose(Math::sqrt));
```

- Question: why? It looks like the same code both times

---

## Typing Issues with compose and Method References

- Answer: typing
<br>
Math::rint does not have a type until it is assigned to a variable or passed to a
method. Any interface that has a single (abstract) method that can take two doubles
could be the target for Math::rint.
<br>But, those other interfaces do not have “compose” method

---

## Higher Order Functions in Consumer

- `andThen`
  - `f1.andThen(f2)` produces a `Consumer` that first passes argument to f1 (i.e., to its
  accept method), then passes argument to f2. Default method
- Difference between andThen of Consumer and of Function
  - With andThen from Consumer, the argument is passed to the accept method of f1,
  then that same argument is passed to the accept method of f2
  - With andThen from Function, the argument is passed to the apply method of f1,
  then the result of apply is passed to the apply method of f2

---

## Test Code: processEntries

- Idea: Given a list and a function, passes each list entry to the function, but does not return
anything
- Very similar to `forEach` method of `Stream` and of `List`, which we will cover later

```java
public static <T> void processEntries(List<T> entries,
                                      Consumer<T> operation) {
    for (T e : entries) {
        operation.accept(e);
    }
}
```

---

## Using processEntries

```java
public static void consumerExamples() {
    List<Employee> myEmployees =
        Arrays.asList(new Employee("Bill", "Gates", 1, 200000),
                      new Employee("Larry", "Ellison", 2, 100000));
    System.out.println("Original employees:");
    processEntries(myEmployees, System.out::println);
    Consumer<Employee> giveRaise = e -> e.setSalary(e.getSalary() * 11 / 10);
    System.out.println("Employees after raise:");
    processEntries(myEmployees, giveRaise.andThen(System.out::println));
}
```

```text
Original employees:
Bill Gates [Employee#1 $200,000]
Larry Ellison [Employee#2 $100,000]
Employees after raise:
Bill Gates [Employee#1 $220,000]
Larry Ellison [Employee#2 $110,000]
```

---

## Higher Order Functions in Comparator

- comparing
<br>Static method that takes function that returns a key and builds a Comparator from it

```java
Arrays.sort(words, Comparator.comparing(String::length));
```

- reversed
<br>Default method that imposes the reverse ordering

```java
Arrays.sort(words, Comparator.comparing(String::length).reversed());
```

---

## Higher Order Functions in Comparator

- thenComparing
<br>Default method that specifies how to break ties in the initial comparison

```java
Arrays.sort(employees, Comparator.comparing(Employee::getLastName)
                            .thenComparing(Employee::getFirstName));
```

---

## Sorting: Comparing Approaches

- Sorting with explicit Comparator

```java
Arrays.sort(words, new Comparator<String>() {
    @Override
    public int compare(String s1, String s2) {
        return(s1.length() - s2.length());
    }
});
```

- Sorting with explicit lambda

```java
Arrays.sort(words, (s1, s2) -> s1.length() - s2.length());
```

- Sorting with method that returns lambda

```java
Arrays.sort(words, Comparator.comparing(String::length));
```

---

## More Examples

```java
private static Employee[] employees = { new Employee("John", "Doe", 1, 234_567),
                                        new Employee("Jane", "Doe", 2, 333_333),
                                        new Employee("Sammy", "Smith", 3, 99_000),
                                        new Employee("Sally", "Smith", 4, 99_000) };
private static String[] words =
    { "hi", "hello", "hola", "bye", "goodbye", "adios" };
public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.printf("Words before sorting: %s.%n", Arrays.asList(words));
    Arrays.sort(words, Comparator.comparing(String::length));
    System.out.printf("After sorting by length: %s.%n", Arrays.asList(words));
    Arrays.sort(words, Comparator.comparing(String::length).reversed());
    System.out.printf("After sorting by length (reversed): %s.%n", Arrays.asList(words));
    System.out.printf("Employees before sorting: %s.%n", Arrays.asList(employees));

    //Entries that are tied by last name remain in their original relative order
    Arrays.sort(employees, Comparator.comparing(Employee::getLastName));
    System.out.printf("After sorting by last name: %s.%n", Arrays.asList(employees));

    //Entries that are tied by last name are sorted by their first name
    Arrays.sort(employees, Comparator.comparing(Employee::getLastName).thenComparing(Employee::getFirstName));
    System.out.printf("After sorting by last name and then first name: %s.%n", Arrays.asList(employees));
    Arrays.sort(employees, Comparator.comparing(Employee::getSalary).thenComparing(Employee::getEmployeeId));
    System.out.printf("After sorting by salary and then ID: %s.%n", Arrays.asList(employees));
}
```

---

## Results

```text
Words before sorting: [hi, hello, hola, bye, goodbye, adios].
After sorting by length: [hi, bye, hola, hello, adios, goodbye].
After sorting by length (reversed): [goodbye, hello, adios, hola, bye, hi].
Employees before sorting:
    [John Doe [Employee#1 $234,567], Jane Doe [Employee#2 $333,333],
     Sammy Smith [Employee#3 $99,000], Sally Smith [Employee#4 $99,000]].
After sorting by last name:
    [John Doe [Employee#1 $234,567], Jane Doe [Employee#2 $333,333],
     Sammy Smith [Employee#3 $99,000], Sally Smith [Employee#4 $99,000]].
After sorting by last name and then first name:
    [Jane Doe [Employee#2 $333,333], John Doe [Employee#1 $234,567],
     Sally Smith [Employee#4 $99,000], Sammy Smith [Employee#3 $99,000]].
After sorting by salary and then ID:
    [Sammy Smith [Employee#3 $99,000], Sally Smith [Employee#4 $99,000],
     John Doe [Employee#1 $234,567], Jane Doe [Employee#2 $333,333]].
```

## Higher Order Functions in Your Own Code

- Idea
  - Return a Predicate, Function, or other lambda from a method. But, embed a local
  variable before returning it. For example, return a Predicate that tests if an
  employee’s salary is above a certain cutoff. Pass the cutoff to the method.

---

## Higher Order Functions in Your Own Code

- Syntax options
  - Use a regular method
    <br>Use normal “return” syntax, but have a lambda as the return value
  - Use a Function
  <br>Technically, this is a regular method (apply). But, you can use “double” lambda syntax:
  a lambda whose expression is another lambda

---

## Building a Predicate to Test for Salary Above a Cutoff

- Regular method

```java
public static Predicate<Employee> buildIsRichPredicate(double salaryLowerBound) {
return(e -> e.getSalary() > salaryLowerBound);
}
```

Then call buildIsRichPredicate(salary) to get a Predicate <!-- .element: style="text-align: left;" -->


- Function

```java
Function<Integer, Predicate<Employee>> makeIsRichPredicate =
salaryLowerBound -> (e -> e.getSalary() > salaryLowerBound);
```

Then call makeIsRichPredicate.apply(salary) to get a Predicate <!-- .element: style="text-align: left;" -->

---

## Using the Tests

```java
public static Predicate<Employee> buildIsRichPredicate(double salaryLowerBound) {
    return(e -> e.getSalary() > salaryLowerBound);
}

public static void customHigherOrderFunctionExamples() {
    List<Employee> richEmployees1 = allMatches(employees, buildIsRichPredicate(200_000));
    System.out.printf("Rich employees [via method that returns Predicate]: %s.%n",
                      richEmployees1);
    Function<Integer, Predicate<Employee>> makeIsRichPredicate =
        salaryLowerBound -> (e -> e.getSalary() > salaryLowerBound);
    List<Employee> richEmployees2 =
        allMatches(employees, makeIsRichPredicate.apply(200_000));
    System.out.printf("Rich employees [via Function that returns Predicate]: %s.%n",
                      richEmployees2);
}
```

---

## Results

```text
Rich employees [via method that returns Predicate]:
    [Harry Hacker [Employee#1 $234,567],
     Polly Programmer [Employee#2 $333,333],
     Desiree Designer [Employee#14 $212,000]].
