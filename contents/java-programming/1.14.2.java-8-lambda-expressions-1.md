# Part 14.2 Lambda Expression Part 1

- Intro
  - Motivation
  - Quick summary of big idea
- New option: lambdas
  - Interpretation
  - Most basic form
  - Type inferencing
  - Expression for body
  - Omitting parens
  - Comparing lambda approaches to alternatives

---

## Why Lambdas in Java Now?

- Concise syntax
  - More succinct and clear than anonymous inner classes

```java
  /**
   * Old
   */
  button.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
    @Override
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
      doSomethingWith(e);
    }
  });

  /**
   * New
   */
  button.addActionListener(e -> doSomethingWith(e));
```

---

## Why Lambdas in Java Now?

- Deficiencies with anonymous inner classes
  - Bulky, confusion re “this” and naming in general, no access to non-final local vars, hard to optimize
- Convenient for new streams library

```java
shapes.forEach(s -> s.setColor(Color.RED));
```

- Programmers are used to the approach
  - Callbacks, closures, map/reduce idiom

---

## Lambdas: Syntax

- You write what looks like a function

```java
Arrays.sort(testStrings, (s1, s2) -> s1.length() - s2.length());
taskList.execute(() -> downloadSomeFile());
someButton.addActionListener(event -> handleButtonClick());
double d = MathUtils.integrate(x -> x*x, 0, 100, 1000);
```

- You get an instance of a class that implements the interface that was expected in that place

---

## Example: Sorting Strings by Length

```java
  /**
   * Java 7 example
   */
  Arrays.sort(testStrings, new Comparator<String>() {
    @Override
    public int compare(String s1, String s2) {
      return(s1.length() - s2.length());
    }
  });

  /**
   * Java 8 example
   */
  Arrays.sort(testStrings, (s1, s2) -> s1.length() - s2.length());
```

---

## Step 1 - Drop Interface and Method Names

-  From the API, Java already knows the second argument to Arrays.sort is a Comparator, so you do not need to say it is a Comparator. Comparator has only one method, so you do not need to say that method name is compare.
-  Add “->” (i.e., dash then greater-than sign) between method params and method body

---

## Step 1 - Drop Interface and Method Names

```java
  /**
   * Java 7
   */
  Arrays.sort(testStrings, new Comparator<String>() {
    @Override
    public int compare(String s1, String s2) {
      return(s1.length() - s2.length());
    }
  });

  /**
   * Java 8 alternative (legal, but not ideal)
   */
  Arrays.sort(testStrings, (String s1, String s2) -> { return(s1.length() - s2.length()); });
```

---

## Step 2 - Drop Parameter Type Declarations

- By looking at the first argument (testStrings), Java can infer that the type of the second argument is Comparator<String>. Thus, parameters for compare are both Strings. Since Java knows this, you do not need to say so.
- Java is still doing strong, compile-time type checking. The compiler is just inferring types. Somewhat similar to how Java infers types for the diamond operator.

```java
List<String> words = new ArrayList<>();
```

- In a few cases, types are ambiguous, and compiler will warn you that it cannot infer the types. In that case, you *cannot* drop the types declarations as below.

---

## Step 2 - Drop Parameter Type Declarations

```java
  /**
   * Previous version
   */
  Arrays.sort(testStrings, (String s1, String s2) -> { return(s1.length() - s2.length()); });

  /**
   * Improved version (legal, but still not ideal)
   */
  Arrays.sort(testStrings, (s1, s2) -> { return(s1.length() - s2.length()); });
```

---

## Step 3 - Use Expression Instead of Block

- If method body can be written as a **single return statement**, you can drop the curly braces and “return”, and just put the return value as an expression.
- This cannot always be done, especially if you use loops or if statements. However, lambdas are most commonly used when the method body is short, so this can usually be done. If not, leaving curly braces and “return” is legal, but if body of lambda is long, you might want to reconsider and use normal inner class instead.

---

## Step 3 - Use Expression Instead of Block

```java
  /**
   * Previous version
   */
  Arrays.sort(testStrings, (s1, s2) -> { return(s1.length() - s2.length()); });

  /**
   * Improved version (ideal)
   */
  Arrays.sort(testStrings, (s1, s2) -> s1.length() - s2.length());
```

---

## [Optional] Step 4 - Omit Parens When there is Exactly One Param

- If the method of the interface has **exactly one parameter**, the parens are optional

```java
  /**
   * Java 7
   */
  button.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
    @Override
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
      doSomethingWith(e);
    }
  });

  /**
   * Java 8 with parens
   */
  button.addActionListener((e) -> doSomethingWith(e));

  /**
   * Java 8 without parens
   */
  button.addActionListener(e -> doSomethingWith(e));
```

---

## Summary: Lambda Syntax

- Omit interface and method names

```java
Arrays.sort(testStrings, new Comparator<String>() {
@Override public int compare(String s1, String s2) { return(s1.length() - s2.length()); }
});
```

replaced by

```java
Arrays.sort(testStrings, (String s1, String s2) -> { return(s1.length() - s2.length()); });
```

- Omit parameter types

```java
Arrays.sort(testStrings, (String s1, String s2) -> { return(s1.length() - s2.length()); });
```

replaced by

```java
Arrays.sort(testStrings, (s1, s2) -> { return(s1.length() - s2.length()); });
```

---

## Summary: Lambda Syntax...

- Use expressions instead of blocks

```java
Arrays.sort(testStrings, (s1, s2) -> { return(s1.length() - s2.length()); });
```

replaced by

```java
Arrays.sort(testStrings, (s1, s2) -> s1.length() - s2.length());
```

- Drop parens if single param to method

```java
button1.addActionListener((event) -> popUpSomeWindow(...));
```

replaced by

```java
button1.addActionListener(event -> popUpSomeWindow(...));
```

---

## Java 7 vs. Java 8

Java 7

```java
  taskList.execute(new Runnable() {
    @Override
    public void run() {
      processSomeImage(imageName);
    }
  });
  button.addActionListener(new ActionListener() {
    @Override
    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) {
      doSomething(event);
    }
  });
```

Java 8

```java
  taskList.execute(() -> processSomeImage(imageName));
  button.addActionListener(event -> doSomething(event));
```

---

## Java vs. JavaScript

Java

```java
  String[] testStrings = {"one", "two", "three", "four"};
  Arrays.sort(testStrings, (s1, s2) -> s1.length() - s2.length());
  Arrays.sort(testStrings, (s1, s2) -> s1.charAt(s1.length() - 1) - s2.charAt(s2.length() - 1));
```

JavaScript

```javascript
  var testStrings = ["one", "two", "three", "four"];
  testStrings.sort(function(s1, s2) { return(s1.length - s2.length);});
  testStrings.sort(function(s1, s2) { return(s1.charCodeAt(s1.length - 1) - s2.charCodeAt(s2.length - 1));});
```


---

## Thinking About Lambdas

- You do this

```java
Arrays.sort(testStrings, (s1, s2) -> s1.length() -s2.length());
```

- What really is happening
  - You used a shortcut way of representing an instance of a class that implements Comparator <T>. You provided the body of the compare method after the “->”.
- How you usually think about it
  - You passed in the comparison function
- Function types
  - Java 8 does not technically have function types, since under the hood, lambdas become instances of classes that implement whatever interface was expected. Nevertheless, you normally think of lambdas as functions.

---

## Where Can Lambdas Be Used?

- Find __any__ variable or parameter that expects an interface that has one method
  - Technically 1 abstract method, but in Java 7 there was no distinction between a 1-method interface and a 1-abstract-method interface. These 1-method interfaces are called “functional interfaces” or “SAM (Single Abstract Method) interfaces”.

```java
public interface Blah { String foo(String someString); }
```

- Code that __uses__ interface is the same
  - Code that uses the interface must still know the real method name in the interface

```java
public void someMethod(Blah b) { … b.foo(…) …}
```

- Code that calls the method that expects the interface can supply lambda

```java
someMethod(s -> s.toUpperCase() + "!");
```

---

## A Few More Samples

- As arguments to methods

```java
Arrays.sort(testStrings, (s1, s2) -> s1.length() - s2.length());
taskList.execute(() -> downloadSomeFile());
button.addActionListener(event -> handleButtonClick());
double d = MathUtils.integrate(x -> x*x, 0, 100, 1000);
```

- As variables (makes real type more obvious)

```java
AutoCloseable c = () -> cleanupForTryWithResources();
Thread.UncaughtExceptionHandler handler = (thread, exception) -> doSomethingAboutException();
Formattable f = (formatter, flags, width, precision) -> makeFormattedString();
ContentHandlerFactory fact = mimeType -> createContentHandlerForMimeType();
CookiePolicy policy = (uri, cookie) -> decideIfCookieShouldBeAccepted();
Flushable toilet = () -> writeBufferedOutputToStream();
TextListener t = event -> respondToChangeInTextValue();
```

---

## Summary: Big Ideas

**Yay! We have lambdas**
- Concise and succinct
- Retrofits into existing APIs
- Familiar to developers that know functional programming
- Fits well with new streams API
- Also have method references and prebuilt functional interfaces

**Boo! We do not have full functional programming (?)**
- Type of a lambda is class that implements interface, not a “real” function
  - Must create or find interface first, must know method name
- Cannot use mutable local variables

---

## Summary: Syntax

- Replace this use of an anonymous inner class

```java
doSomething(new SomeOneMethodInterface() {
  @Override
  public SomeType methodOfInterface(args) {
    return(value);
  }
});
```

- With this use of a lambda

```java
doSomething((args) -> value);
```

And, if method has exactly one parameter, you can omit parens around the args

- Defining a one-method interface to use with lambdas
  - Interface itself is almost the same as Java 7 (except for annotation we will see later)
  - Code that uses the interface is exactly the same as in Java 7
  - Code that calls method that expects the interface type can now use lambda
