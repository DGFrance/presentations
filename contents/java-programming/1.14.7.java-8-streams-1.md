# Part 14.7 Java 8 Streams Part 1

---

## Overview of Streams

---

## Comparison to List (1)

* **Streams have more convenient methods than Lists**
    * forEach, filter, map, reduce, min, sorted, distinct, limit, etc.


* **Streams have cool properties that Lists lack**
    * Making streams more powerful, faster, and more memory efficient than Lists
    * The three coolest properties
        * Lazy evaluation
        * Automatic parallelization
        * Infinite (unbounded) streams

---

## Comparison to List (2)

* **Streams do not store data**
    * They are just programmatic wrappers around existing data sources
        * Usually Lists or arrays, but later we will see you can have a function as a data source
          (Stream.generate), and the function is called each time that you need a Stream entry

---

## Confusion Overuse of the Term "Stream" (1)


* **I/O streams**
    * Input streams: low-level data structures for reading from socket or file or other input
      source.
        * InputStream, ObjectInputStream, FileInputStream, ByteArrayInputStream, etc.
          Introduced in early Java versions.
    * Output streams: low-level data structures for sending data to socket or file.
        * OutputStream, ObjectOutputStream, FileOutputStream, ByteArrayOutputStream, etc.

---

## Confusion Overuse of the Term "Stream" (2)


* **Java 8 Stream interface**
    * Stream`<T>` (e.g., Stream`<String>`): High-level wrapper around arrays, Lists, and
      other data source. Introduced in Java 8.
    * IntStream, DoubleStream, etc. Specializations of Java 8 streams for numbers.

---

## Streams

* **Big idea**
    * Wrappers around data sources such as arrays or lists. Support many convenient and
      high-performance operations expressed succinctly with lambdas, executed
      sequentially or in parallel.


* **Quick preview**

```java
            Employee firstRich =
                                   Stream.of(idArray).map(EmployeeUtils::findById)
                                   .filter(e -> e != null)
                                   .filter(e -> e.getSalary() > 500_000)
                                   .findFirst()
                                   .orElse(null));
```

---

## Another Quick Preview

* **Goal**
    * Given very large file of words of various lengths in mixed case with possible repeats, create sorted uppercase file of n-letter words


```java

    List<String> words = Files.lines(Paths.get(inputFileName))
                            .filter(s -> s.length() == n)
                            .map(String::toUpperCase)
                            .distinct()
                            .sorted()
                            .collect(Collectors.toList());
    Files.write(Paths.get(outputFileName), words,
                Charset.defaultCharset());

```

---

## Characteristics of Streams (1)


* **Not data structures**
    * Streams have _no_ storage; they carry values from a source through a pipeline of
      operations.
        * They also never modify the underlying data structure (e.g., the List or array that the
          Stream wraps)


* **Designed for lambdas**
    * All Stream operations take lambdas as arguments.


* **Do not support indexed access**
    * You can ask for the first element, but not the second or third or last element.
    * But, see next bullet.

---

## Characteristics of Streams (2)


* **Can easily be output as Lists or arrays**
    * Simple syntax to build a List or array from a Stream


* **Lazy**
    * Most Stream operations are postponed until it is known how much data is eventually
      needed.
        * E.g., if you do a 10-second-per-item operation on a 100-element stream, then select
          the first entry, it takes 10 seconds, not 1000 seconds.

---

## Characteristics of Streams (3)


* Parallelizable
    * If you designate a Stream as parallel, then operations on it will automatically be
      done in parallel, without having to write explicit fork/join or threading code.


* Can be unbounded
    * Unlike with collections, you can designate a generator function, and clients can
      consume entries as long as they want, with values being generated on the fly.

---

## Getting Standard Data Structures Into and Out of Streams

---

## Making Streams: Overview (1)


* **Big idea**
    * Streams are not collections: they do not manage their own data. Instead, they are
      wrappers around existing data structures.
        * When you make or transform a Stream, it does not copy the underlying data. Instead, it
          just builds a pipeline of operations. How many times that pipeline will be invoked
          depends on what you later do with the stream (find the first element, skip some
          elements, see if all elements match a Predicate, etc.)

---

## Making Streams: Overview (2)


* **Three most common ways to make a Stream**
    * _someList.stream()_
    * _Stream.of(arrayOfObjects)_ [not array of primitives!]
    * _Stream.of(val1, val2, ..)_

---

## Making Streams: Examples


* **From Lists**

```java

List<String> words = ..;
words.stream().map(..).filter(..).other(..);
List<Employee> workers = ..;
workers.stream().map(..).filter(..).other(..);

```


* **From object arrays**

```java

Employee[] workers = ..;
Stream.of(workers).map(..).filter(..).other(..);

```


* **From individual elements**

```java

Employee e1 = ..;
Employee e2 = ..;
Stream.of(e1,e2, ..).map(..).filter(..).other(..);

```

---

## Making Streams: More Options (1)


* **From List (and other collections)**
    * someList.stream(), someOtherCollection.stream()


* **From object array**
    * Stream.of(someArray), Arrays.stream(someArray)


* **From individual values**
    * Stream.of(val1, val2, ..)


* **From a function**
    * Stream.generate, Stream.iterate


* **From a file**
    * Files.lines(somePath)

---

## Making Streams: More Options (2)


* **From a StreamBuilder**
    * someBuilder.build()


* **From String**
    * String.chars, Stream.of(someString.split(..))


* **From another Stream**
    * distinct, filter, limit, map, sorted, skip

---

## Turning Streams into Pre-Java-8 Data Structures


* **List (most common)**
    * someStream.collect(Collectors.toList())


* **Array (less common)**
    * someStream.toArray(EntryType[]::new)
        * E.g., employeeStream.toArray(Employee[]::new)


* **Note**
    * You normally do this only at the end, after you have done all the cool Stream
      operations. E.g.:
      List<SomeType> values = someStream.map(..).filter(..).map(..).filter(..).collect(..);

---

## Outputting Streams: Examples (1)


* **Outputting as Lists**

```java

List<String> wordList =
someStream.map(someLambdaThatReturnsString)
    .filter(someTestOnStrings)
    .collect(Collectors.toList());

```

```java

List<Employee> workerList =
someStream.map(someLambda).collect(Collectors.toList());

```


---

## Outputting Streams: Examples (2)



* **Outputting as arrays**

```java

String[] wordArray =
someStream.map(someLambdaThatReturnsString)
    .filter(someTestOnStrings)
    .toArray(String[]::new);

```

```java

Employee[] workerList =
someStream.map(someLambda).toArray(Employee[]::new);

```


---

## toArray and Array Constructor References


* **Usual case**
    * Tells Java to make an empty EntryType[], then that array is filled in with elements from the Stream

```java

EntryType[] myArray =
    myStream.toArray(EntryType[]::new);

```


* **General case**
    * The lambda is an IntFunction that takes an int (size) as an argument, and returns an empty array that can be filled in

```java

EntryType[] myArray =
    myStream.toArray(n -> buildEmptyArray(n));

```

---

## Core Stream Methods: Overview

---

## Stream Methods


* **Big idea**
    * You wrap a Stream around an array or List (or even a file, as seen in File I/O lecture). Then, you can do operations on each element (forEach), make a new Stream by transforming each element (map), remove elements that dont match some criterion (filter), etc.


* **Core methods (covered here)**
    * forEach, map, filter, findFirst, findAny, collect, toArray


* **Methods covered in later sections**
    * reduce, collect, min, max, sum, sorted, distinct, limit, skip, noneMatch, allMatch,
      anyMatch, count

---

## Core Stream Methods (1)


* **forEach(Consumer)**

```java

employees.forEach(e -> e.setSalary(e.getSalary() * 11/10))

```


* **map(Function)**

```java

ids.map(EmployeeUtils::findEmployeeById)

```


* **filter(Predicate)**

```java

employees.filter(e -> e.getSalary() > 500000)

```

---

## Core Stream Methods (2)

* **findFirst()**

```java

employees.filter(..).findFirst().orElse(defaultValue)

```


* **toArray(ResultType[]::new)**

```java

Employee[] empArray = employees.toArray(Employee[]::new);

```


* **collect(Collectors.toList())**

```java

List<Employee> empList =
employees.collect(Collectors.toList());

```
---

## Stream Examples: Setup Code (1)
```java

public class EmployeeSamples {
    private static List<Employee> GOOGLERS = Arrays.asList(
        new Employee("Larry", "Page", 1, 9999999),
        new Employee("Sergey", "Brin", 2, 8888888),
        new Employee("Eric", "Schmidt", 3, 7777777),
        new Employee("Nikesh", "Arora", 4, 6666666),
        new Employee("David", "Drummond", 5, 5555555),
        new Employee("Patrick", "Pichette", 6, 4444444),
        new Employee("Susan", "Wojcicki", 7, 3333333),
        new Employee("Peter", "Norvig", 8, 900000),
        new Employee("Jeffrey", "Dean", 9, 800000),
        new Employee("Sanjay", "Ghemawat", 10, 700000),
        new Employee("Gilad", "Bracha", 11, 600000) );

    public static List<Employee> getGooglers() {
        return(GOOGLERS);
    }

```

---
## Stream Examples: Setup Code (2)
```java

private static final List<Employee> SAMPLE_EMPLOYEES = Arrays.asList(
    new Employee("Harry", "Hacker", 1, 234567),
    new Employee("Polly", "Programmer", 2, 333333),
    new Employee("Cody", "Coder", 8, 199999),
    new Employee("Devon", "Developer", 11, 175000),
    new Employee("Desiree", "Designer", 14, 212000),
    new Employee("Archie", "Architect", 16, 144444),
    new Employee("Tammy", "Tester", 19, 166777),
    new Employee("Sammy", "Sales", 21, 45000),
    new Employee("Larry", "Lawyer", 22, 33000),
    new Employee("Amy", "Accountant", 25, 85000) );

public static List<Employee> getSampleEmployees() {
    return(SAMPLE_EMPLOYEES);
}

```

---
## Using the Sample Employees (1)


* **Right: re-stream the List each time**

```java

List<Employee> googlers = EmployeeSamples.getGooglers();
googlers.stream().map(..).filter(..).other(..);
googlers.stream().filter(..).forEach(..);

```

---
## Using the Sample Employees (2)

* **Wrong: reuse the Stream**

```java

Stream<Employee> googlerStream =
EmployeeSamples.getGooglers().stream();
googlerStream.map(..).filter(..).other(..);
googlerStream.filter(..).forEach(..);

```


* **Explanation**
    * You can only do one chain of operations on each Stream!
        * However, it does not cost you anything to "re-stream" the List<Employee>, because "creating" a Stream just points at the existing data structure behind the scenes; it does not copy the data.


---

## forEach - Calling a Lambda on Each Element of a Stream

---

## forEach (1)


* **Big idea**
    * Easy way to loop over Stream elements
        * There are also forEach methods directly in List (from Iterable), Map, etc.
    * You supply a function (as a lambda) to forEach, and that function is called on each element of the Stream
        * More precisely, you supply a Consumer to forEach, and each element of the Stream is passed to that Consumer's accept method. But, few people think of it in these low-level terms.

---

## forEach (2)


* **Quick examples**
    * Print each element
        * Stream.of(someArray).forEach(System.out::println);
    * Clear all text fields
        * fieldList.stream().forEach(field -> field.setText(""));

---

## forEach vs. for Loops (1)


* **for**

```java

for(Employee e: empList) {
    e.setSalary(e.getSalary() * 11/10);
}

```


* **forEach**

```java

empList().stream().forEach(e -> e.setSalary(e.getSalary() * 11/10));

```

---

## forEach vs. for Loops (2)


* **Advantages of forEach**
    * Minor: designed for lambdas
        * Marginally more succinct
    * Minor: reusable
        * You can save the lambda and use it again (see example)
    * Major: can be made parallel with minimal effort
        * _someStream.parallel().forEach(someLambda)_;

---

## What You Cannot do with forEach


* **Loop twice**
    * forEach is a "terminal operation", which means that it consumes the elements of the Stream. So, this is illegal:

```java
someStream.forEach(element -> doOneThing(element));
someStream.forEach(element -> doAnotherThing(element));
```


* **Change values of surrounding local variables**
   * Illegal attempt to calculate total yearly payroll:

```java
    double total = 0;
    employeeList.stream().forEach(e -> total += e.getSalary());

```


* **Break out of the loop early**
    * You cannot use "break" or "return" to terminate looping

---

## forEach Example: Separate Lambdas


* **Code**

```java
List<Employee> googlers = EmployeeSamples.getGooglers();
googlers.stream().forEach(System.out::println);
googlers.stream().forEach(e -> e.setSalary(e.getSalary() * 11/10));
googlers.stream().forEach(System.out::println);
```


* **Results**

```java
Larry Page [Employee#1 $9,999,999]
Sergey Brin [Employee#2 $8,888,888]
Eric Schmidt [Employee#3 $7,777,777]
..
Larry Page [Employee#1 $10,999,998]
Sergey Brin [Employee#2 $9,777,776]
Eric Schmidt [Employee#3 $8,555,554]
..
```
---

## forEach Example: Reusing a Lambda


* **Code**

```java
Consumer<Employee> giveRaise = e -> {
    System.out.printf("%s earned $%,d before raise.%n",
    e.getFullName(), e.getSalary());
    e.setSalary(e.getSalary() * 11/10);
    System.out.printf("%s will earn $%,d after raise.%n",
    e.getFullName(), e.getSalary());
};
googlers.stream().forEach(giveRaise);
sampleEmployees.stream().forEach(giveRaise);
```


* **Results**

```java
Larry Page earned $10,999,998 before raise.
Larry Page will earn $12,099,997 after raise.
Sergey Brin earned $9,777,776 before raise.
Sergey Brin will earn $10,755,553 after raise.
..
```
---

## map - Transforming a Stream by Passing Each Element through a Function

---

## map (1)


* **Big idea**
    * Produces a new Stream that is the result of applying a Function to each element of
      original Stream
        * There is also a similar method (replaceAll) directly in List, but where the input and
          output types of the function must be the same


* **Quick examples**
    * Array of squares

```java
Double[] nums = { 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0 };
Double[] squares =
Stream.of(nums).map(n -> n * n).toArray(Double[]::new);
```

---

## map (2)

* **Quick examples**
    * List of Employees with given IDs


```java
Integer[] ids = { 1, 2, 4, 8 }; // Integer[], not int[]
List<Employee> matchingEmployees =
Stream.of(ids).map(EmployeeUtils::findById)
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

---

## map Examples: Helper Code to Find Employee by ID


* **Employee Map**

```java
private static Map<Integer,Employee> googleMap = new HashMap<>();
static {
    GOOGLERS.stream()
        .forEach(e -> googleMap.put(e.getEmployeeId(), e));
}
```


* **Employee lookup method**

```java
public static Employee findGoogler(Integer employeeId) {
    return(googleMap.get(employeeId));
}
```

---

## map Examples: Helper Method for Printing


* **Turn Stream into List, then print the List**

```java
private static void printStream(Stream s, String message) {
    System.out.printf("%s: %s.%n",
        message, s.collect(Collectors.toList()));
}
```



* **Example usage**

```java
printStream(someList.stream().map(..).filter(..).filter(..),
    "Results after mapping and filtering");
```



* **Example results**

```java
Results after mapping and filtering: [a, b, c]
```

---

## map Example: Numbers


* **Code**

```java
List<Double> nums = Arrays.asList(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0);
printStream(nums.stream(), "Original nums");
printStream(nums.stream().map(n -> n * n), "Squares");
printStream(nums.stream().map(n -> n * n).map(Math::sqrt),
    "Square roots of the squares");
```


* **Results**

```java
Original nums: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0].
Squares: [1.0, 4.0, 9.0, 16.0, 25.0].
Square roots of the squares: [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0].
```

---

## map Example: Employees


* **Code**

```java
Integer[] ids = { 1, 2, 4, 8 };
printStream(Stream.of(ids), "IDs");
printStream(Stream.of(ids).map(EmployeeSamples::findGoogler)
    .map(Person::getFullName),
    "Names of Googlers with given IDs");
```


* **Results**

```java
IDs: [1, 2, 4, 8].
Names of Googlers with given IDs:
[Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Nikesh Arora, Peter Norvig].
```

---

## Related Mapping Methods (1)


* **mapToInt**
    * Applies a function that produces an Integer, but the resultant Stream is an IntStream
      instead of a Stream<Integer>. Convenient because IntStream has no-argument
      methods like sum, min, and max
        * IntStream and DoubleStream are covered in more detail in later section


* **mapToDouble**
    * Similar to mapToInt, but produces DoubleStream

---

## Related Mapping Methods (2)


* **flatMap**
    * Each function application produces a Stream, then the Stream elements are
      combined into a single Stream. For example, if company is a List of departments,
      this produces a Stream of all combined employees

```java
company.stream().flatMap(dept -> dept.employeeList().stream())
```

---

## filter - Keeping Only the Elements that Pass a Predicate

---

## filter (1)


* **Big idea**
    * Produces a new Stream that contain only the elements of the original Stream that pass a
      given test (Predicate)
        * There is similar method (removeIf) directly in List, but filter keeps entries that pass whereas
          removeIf deletes ones that pass


---

## filter (2)

* **Even numbers**

```java
Integer[] nums = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };
Integer[] evens = Stream.of(nums).filter(n -> n%2 == 0)
    .toArray(Integer[]::new);
```

* **Even numbers greater than 3**

```java
Integer[] evens = Stream.of(nums).filter(n -> n%2 == 0)
    .filter(n -> n>3)
    .toArray(Integer[]::new);
```

---

## filter Example: Numbers


* **Code**

```java
Integer[] nums = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 };
printStream(Stream.of(nums), "Original nums");
printStream(Stream.of(nums).filter(n -> n%2 == 0),
    "Even nums");
printStream(Stream.of(nums).filter(n -> n>3),
    "Nums > 3");
printStream(Stream.of(nums).filter(n -> n%2 == 0)
    .filter(n -> n>3),
    "Even nums > 3");
```


* **Results**

```java
Original nums: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].
Even nums: [2, 4, 6].
Nums > 3: [4, 5, 6].
Even nums > 3: [4, 6].
```

---

## filter Example: Employees


* **Code**

```java
Integer[] ids = { 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 };
printStream(Stream.of(ids).map(EmployeeSamples::findGoogler)
    .filter(e -> e != null)
    .filter(e -> e.getSalary() > 500_000),
    "Googlers with salaries over $500K");
```


* **Results**

```java
Googlers with salaries over $500K:
[Peter Norvig [Employee#8 $900,000],
Nikesh Arora [Employee#4 $6,666,666],
Sergey Brin [Employee#2 $8,888,888],
Larry Page [Employee#1 $9,999,999]].
```

## findFirst - Returning the First Element of a Stream while Short-Circuiting Earlier Operations

---

## findFirst (1)


* **Big idea**
    * Returns an Optional for the first entry in the Stream. Since Streams are often results of filtering, there might not be a first entry, so the Optional could be empty.
        * There is also a similar findAny method, which might be faster for parallel Streams (which are in later tutorial).
    * findFirst is faster than it looks when paired with map or filter. More details in section on lazy evaluation, but idea is that map and filter know to stop after a single entry is found.

---

## findFirst (2)

* **When you know for certain that there is at least one entry**

```java
someStream.map(..).findFirst().get()
```

* **When unsure if there are entries or not (more common)**

```java
someStream.filter(..).findFirst().orElse(otherValue)
```

---

## Aside: the Optional Class (1)


* **Big idea**
    * Optional either stores a T or stores nothing. Useful for methods that may or may not
      find a value. New in Java 8.
        * The value of findFirst of Stream`<Blah>` is an Optional`<Blah>`


---

## Aside: the Optional Class (2)


* **Syntax**
    * Making an Optional (usually done behind the scenes by builtin methods)
        * Optional`<Blah>` value = Optional.of(someBlah);
        * Optional`<Blah>` value = Optional.empty(); // Missing val
    * Most common operations on an Optional (often done by your code)
        * value.get() - returns value if present or throws exception
        * value.orElse(other) - returns value if present or returns other
        * value.orElseGet(Supplier) - returns value if present or calls function
        * value.isPresent() - returns true if value is present


---
## Quick Preview of Lazy Evaluation (1)


* **Code (Employee with ID 8 is first match)**

```java
Integer[] ids = { 16, 8, 4, ..}; // 10,000 entries
System.out.printf("First Googler with salary over $500K: %s%n",
Stream.of(ids).map(EmployeeSamples::findGoogler)
    .filter(e -> e != null)
    .filter(e -> e.getSalary() > 500_000)
    .findFirst()
    .orElse(null));
```


* **Questions**
    * How many times is:
        * findGoogler called?
        * The null check performed?
        * getSalary called?
    * What if there were 10,000,000 ids instead of 10,000 ids?

---

## Quick Preview of Lazy Evaluation (2)


* **Code (Employee with ID 8 is first match)**

```java
Integer[] ids = { 16, 8, 4, ..}; // 10,000 entries
System.out.printf("First Googler with salary over $500K: %s%n",
Stream.of(ids).map(EmployeeSamples::findGoogler)
    .filter(e -> e != null)
    .filter(e -> e.getSalary() > 500_000)
    .findFirst()
    .orElse(null));
```


* **Answers**
    * findGoogler: 2
    * Check for null: 2

## Lazy Evaluation

---

## Overview (1)


* **Big idea**
    * Streams defer doing most operations until you actually need the results


* **Result**
    * Operations that appear to traverse Stream multiple times actually traverse it only
      once

---

## Overview (2)

* Due to "short-circuit" methods, operations that appear to traverse entire stream can stop much earlier.
    * **stream.map(someOp).filter(someTest).findFirst().get()**
       * Does the map and filter operations one element at a time (first a map, then a filter on element 1, then map and filter on element 2, etc.). Continues only until first match on the filter test.
    * **stream.map(..).filter(..).filter(..).allMatch(someTest)**
       * Does the one map, two filter, and one allMatch test one element at a time. The first time it gets false for the allMatch test, it stops

## Method Types: Overview (1)


* **Intermediate methods**
    * These are methods that produce other Streams. These methods don't get processed
      until there is some terminal method called.


* **Terminal methods**
    * After one of these methods is invoked, the Stream is considered consumed and no
      more operations can be performed on it
        * These methods can do a side-effect (forEach) or produce a value (findFirst)

---

## Method Types: Overview (2)


* **Short-circuit methods**
    * These methods cause the earlier intermediate methods to be processed only until the
      short-circuit method can be evaluated.
        * Short-circuit methods can be intermediate (limit, skip) or terminal (findFirst, allMatch)
    * E.g., this example only filters until it finds first match:

```java
Stream.of(someArray).filter(e -> someTest(e)).findFirst().orElse(default)
```

---

## Method Types: Listing by Categories


* **Intermediate methods**
    * map (and related mapToInt, flatMap, etc.), filter, distinct, sorted, peek, limit, skip,
      parallel, sequential, unordered


* **Terminal methods**
    * forEach, forEachOrdered, toArray, reduce, collect, min, max, count, anyMatch,
      allMatch, noneMatch, findFirst, findAny, iterator


* **Short-circuit methods**
    * anyMatch, allMatch, noneMatch, findFirst, findAny, limit, skip

---

## Example of Lazy Evaluation and Terminal Methods


* **Code**

```java
Stream.of(idArray).map(EmployeeUtils::findById)
    .filter(e -> e != null)
    .filter(e -> e.getSalary() > 500_000)
    .findFirst()
    .orElse(null));
```


* **Apparent behavior**
    * findById on all, check all for null, call getSalary on all non-null on all remaining, find first, return it or null


* **Actual behavior**
    * findById on first, check it for null, if pass, call getSalary, if salary > $500K, return and done. Repeat for second, etc.

## Lazy Evaluation: Showing Order of Operations


```java
Function<Integer,Employee> findGoogler =
    n -> { System.out.println("Finding Googler with ID " + n);
        return(EmployeeSamples.findGoogler(n));
    };
Predicate<Employee> checkForNull =
    e -> { System.out.println("Checking for null");
        return(e != null);
    };
Predicate<Employee> checkSalary =
    e -> { System.out.println("Checking if salary > $500K");
        return(e.getSalary() > 500_000);
    };
```

---

## Lazy Evaluation: Order of Operations and Short-Circuiting


* **Code**

```java
Integer[] ids = { 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 };
System.out.printf("First Googler with salary over $500K: %s%n",
Stream.of(ids).map(findGoogler)
    .filter(checkForNull)
    .filter(checkSalary)
    .findFirst()
    .orElse(null));
```


* **Results**

```java
Finding Googler with ID 16
Checking for null
Finding Googler with ID 8
Checking for null
Checking if salary > $500K
First Googler with salary over $500K: Peter Norvig [Employee#8 $900,000]
```

## Wrap-Up

---

## Summary (1)


* **Make a Stream**
    * someList.stream(), Stream.of(objectArray), Stream.of(e1, e2..)


* **Output from a Stream**
    * stream.collect(Collectors.toList())
    * stream.toArray(Blah[]::new)


* **forEach [void output]**
    * employeeStream.forEach(e -> e.setPay(e.getPay() * 1.1))

---

## Summary (2)


* **map [outputs a Stream]**
    * numStream.map(Math::sqrt)


* **filter [outputs a Stream]**
    * employeeStream.filter(e -> e.getSalary() > 500_000)


* **findFirst [outputs an Optional]**
    * stream.findFirst().get(), stream.findFirst().orElse(other)
