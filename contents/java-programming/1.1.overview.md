# Part 1 Overview

- Characteristics
- Platform
- Java code structure

## Characteristics

- Simple, Object Oriented, and Familiar
- Robust and Secure
- Architecture Neutral and Portable
- High Performance
- Interpreted, Threaded, and Dynamic

Note:

Simple doesn't mean easy to create program, programming is always hard.
- Automatic memory management (GC)
- Simplifies pointer handling
- Simple Network Library (Socket/DBMS)
- Designed to be object oriented from the ground up
- C++ syntax streamlined
- C# similarity
- Has a rich set of standard libraries: networking, thread, persistence, data structure, web service
- Restrictions on permissible operations can be enforced: memory manipulation, applet by default has no permission to read/write file and execute local program
- Extensive compile-time checking, and run-time checking for security
- JVM optimization
- Static compile time, Dynamic run-time

---

## Platform

A platform is the hardware or software environment in which a program runs.

- Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
- Java Application Programming Interface (API)

<small>The Java platform can be a bit slower than native code due to its platform-independent environment. However Java provides just in time (JIT) compilation and optimization which bring performance close to native code.</small>

## "Hello World!"

- Code <!-- .element: class="fa-code" -->

```java
package com.mitrais.app;

/**
 * The HelloWorldApp class implements an application that
 * simply prints "Hello World!" to standard output.
 */
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!"); // Display the string.
    }
}
```

- Compile and Run <!-- .element: class="fa-code" -->

```bash
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
Hello World!
```

Note:
Discuss about comments syntax, class definition, main method, usage of core library System.out

---

## Java Byte Code

```bash
javap -c  HelloWorld

public class HelloWorld {
  public HelloWorld();
    Code:
       0: aload_0
       1: invokespecial #1      // Method java/lang/Object."<init>":()V
       4: return

  public static void main(java.lang.String[]);
    Code:
       0: getstatic     #2      // Field java/lang/System.out:Ljava/io/PrintStream;
       3: ldc           #3      // String Hello, World!
       5: invokevirtual #4      // Method java/io/PrintStream.println:(Ljava/lang/String;)V
       8: return
}
```

## Summary

- Java is a general purpose language: desktop, web, mobile, more
- Java has a number of good features, but not better in every way than all other languages
- What makes Java better is not the language itself but also the JVM
- Reasons for using Java
  - Features, widespread use, tools, and libraries, platform
  - Java is not the only hammer you have
